# Process
## Skeleton

- The body has a main div under the class "container" that collects all elements, with the exception of the footer, to keep it below the main content.
- Inside the main the we find h2, table, p, ul, furthermore img, audio and form tags for its respective pages.

## Design and Styling
The website was designed with the intent of having a colour pallete of contrast to each other, that is in parallel with the Spa itself.
- The color Hex [#e6ddcd](https://www.color-hex.com/color/e6ddcd) would then emulate the wooden properties of the Sauna while the [#363636](https://www.color-hex.com/color/363636) and [#777777](https://www.color-hex.com/color/777777) would mimic stone surfaces of the same.
