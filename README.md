The 'Sauna World' website is an informative page for people who want to visit our Spa/Sauna facilities.

Visitors of this website will find useful information about our Spa.
Opening times, current price listings, contact information, furthermore to be able to share their opinion about our services.
The website is targeted to people who are looking for leisure activities, wellness and therapeutic experiences.

# Live Project
The live website can be found [here](https://tiagoma90.github.io/sauna-world/index.html).

## Purpose of the website.
- To promote the Spa facilities and attract consumers, in and outside the area.

- To invite and inspire users to visit and regularly attend the Spa.

## Target Audience
- People who want to take advantage of wellness and leisure through relaxation, after physical activities, such as sport.
- People who are primarly in search of therapy as a way to improve their health conditions.

## Design and Styling
- The website was designed with the intent of having a colour pallete of contrast, that are in parallel with the Spa itself.
- The color Hex #e6ddcd would then emulate the wooden properties of the Sauna while the #363636 and #777777 would mimic stone surfaces of the same.
